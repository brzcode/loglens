# Story 2.3: Format and Prioritize the Final Report

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a **security analyst**
- I want **the system to generate a prioritized, human-readable summary report that displays the top 3-5 most critical findings with clear context and actionable information**
- so that **I can quickly understand the most important threats in my log data without being overwhelmed by low-priority noise**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. System generates a console-based summary report displaying top 3-5 highest-risk findings by default
2. Report includes clear risk scoring, threat descriptions, and contextual information for each finding
3. Findings are prioritized using multi-factor risk scoring (base detection + IP reputation + frequency patterns)
4. Report displays IP reputation enrichment data when available (malicious indicators, confidence scores)
5. Verbose mode shows extended findings list (up to 10) with additional technical details
6. Report format is clean, readable, and structured for terminal display across different platforms
7. Optional file output saves the complete report to specified path
8. Report includes executive summary with analysis overview and key statistics

## Dev Notes

### Technical Guidance

**Key Architecture Insights from Previous Stories:**
- DetectionEngine from Story 1.4 + 2.2 provides comprehensive findings with multi-detector support
- IP enrichment data available from Story 2.1 stored in finding.enrichment_data["ip_reputation"] 
- Advanced frequency patterns from Story 2.2 include time-windowed analysis and behavioral indicators
- Finding objects contain: risk_score, finding_type, description, log_entry, enrichment_data
- CLI architecture in main.py supports verbose mode and output file options
- Current output shows basic statistics but lacks prioritized summary report

**Report Requirements from PRD** [Source: docs/prd/2-functional-requirements-mvp.md]:
- **Summary Report Generation**: Human-readable, text-based summary displayed in console
- **Report Prioritization**: Top 3-5 most critical findings displayed first
- **Noise Filtering**: Only suspicious findings included, filtering out benign entries
- **IP Reputation Context**: Enrichment data displayed alongside findings

**User Experience Requirements** [Source: docs/prd/4-user-interaction-and-design-goals.md]:
- **Text as UI**: Well-structured output using spacing and minimal symbols for terminal readability
- **Default View**: Prioritized summary of top 3-5 findings as standard output
- **Verbose View**: Detailed information and larger number of findings with -v flag
- **Platform Support**: Must function correctly in bash, zsh, and PowerShell terminals

**Integration with Current Architecture** [Source: Stories 1.4, 2.1, 2.2 completion notes]:
- Use existing Finding and DetectionResult models from detection service
- Leverage enrichment_data["ip_reputation"] structure from enrichment service
- Build upon established CLI patterns in main.py with verbose/output options
- Maintain generator-based memory efficiency for large finding sets
- Follow error handling patterns established in previous services

**File Locations** [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]:
- New reporting service: `src/loglens/services/reporting.py` (create new)
- Report configuration: `src/loglens/core/config.py` (extend existing)
- CLI integration: `src/loglens/main.py` (replace current output section)
- Reporting tests: `tests/test_reporting.py` (create new test file)

**Tech Stack Considerations** [Source: docs/architecture/definitive-tech-stack-selections.md]:
- Python string formatting and f-strings for report text generation
- Typer for CLI integration and file output handling
- Pydantic models for report configuration and validation
- Type hints required for all reporting methods and models
- Terminal-safe characters and ANSI formatting for cross-platform display

**Risk Scoring Enhancement**:
- **Base Detection Risk**: Original risk_score from detector (0-100)
- **IP Reputation Multiplier**: Malicious IPs increase risk by 20-40 points
- **Frequency Pattern Severity**: Time-windowed patterns add 10-30 points based on intensity  
- **Geographic Risk Factor**: High-risk countries add 5-15 points to final score
- **Final Risk Categories**: Critical (90+), High (70-89), Medium (40-69), Low (0-39)
