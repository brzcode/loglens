# Story 2.2: Implement Additional Detection Logic (Frequency)

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a **security analyst**
- I want **the system to detect advanced frequency-based attack patterns and behavioral anomalies in log data**
- so that **I can identify sophisticated attacks like brute force attempts, scanning activities, and denial-of-service patterns that simple keyword detection might miss**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. System detects time-windowed brute force attempts with configurable time intervals
2. System identifies scanning patterns (multiple endpoints accessed by single IP)
3. System detects burst request patterns indicating potential DoS attacks
4. System identifies unusual user agent frequencies and rotating user agent patterns
5. System detects geographic anomalies when IP enrichment data is available
6. Frequency patterns are integrated with existing detection engine without breaking current functionality
7. Advanced frequency detectors support configurable thresholds and time windows
8. CLI displays enhanced frequency detection statistics with pattern details

## Dev Notes

### Technical Guidance

**Key Architecture Insights from Previous Stories:**
- FrequencyDetector foundation from Story 1.4 provides basic failed login and high-frequency detection
- IP enrichment data available from Story 2.1 with geographic information in enrichment_data["ip_reputation"]
- DetectionEngine architecture supports multiple detectors with combined results
- Finding objects have enrichment_data field for storing additional pattern context
- CLI integration pattern established with statistics display and verbose mode support
- Generator patterns maintain memory efficiency for large datasets

**Enhanced Detection Requirements**:
- **Time-Windowed Analysis**: Sliding windows for more accurate frequency detection
- **Scanning Detection**: Multiple endpoint access patterns, directory traversal attempts  
- **Behavioral Anomalies**: User agent rotation, request size patterns, burst detection
- **Geographic Analysis**: Location-based anomaly detection using IP enrichment data
- **Advanced Thresholds**: Configurable time windows and frequency limits per attack type

**Integration with Existing Services** [Source: Story 1.4 + 2.1 completion notes]:
- Use existing Finding and DetectionResult models for consistency
- Leverage IP enrichment data from enrichment_data["ip_reputation"] for geographic analysis
- Maintain compatibility with current DetectionEngine architecture
- Follow established error handling and statistics tracking patterns
- Preserve generator-based memory efficiency for large log processing

**File Locations** [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]:
- Enhanced detection service: `src/loglens/services/detection.py` (extend existing)
- Configuration updates: `src/loglens/core/config.py` (add frequency detection settings)
- Detection tests: `tests/test_detection.py` (extend existing test file)
- CLI integration: `src/loglens/main.py` (update existing detection display)

**Tech Stack Considerations** [Source: architecture/definitive-tech-stack-selections.md]:
- Use Python collections (defaultdict, Counter) for frequency tracking
- Datetime module for time window calculations and sliding window analysis
- Pydantic for configuration model validation and threshold management
- Type hints required for all new detection methods
- Follow established generator patterns from existing FrequencyDetector

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] pytest Unit Tests: coverage requirement: 85%
- [ ] pytest Integration Test: location: `tests/test_detection.py` (extend existing)
- [ ] E2E Test: Not required for detection layer, CLI integration testing sufficient

Manual Test Steps:
- Create test logs with time-distributed attack patterns across different windows
- Run `loglens analyze [frequency-attack-log] --verbose` and verify advanced detection works
- Test with scanning simulation logs to validate endpoint enumeration detection
- Verify DoS burst detection with high-frequency request logs
- Test geographic anomaly detection with multi-country IP simulation
- Confirm enhanced frequency statistics display in CLI output
- Validate backward compatibility with existing detection functionality
