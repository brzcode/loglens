# Story 1.2: Log File Ingestion

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a **log analyst**
- I want **the ability to ingest and read log files**
- so that **I can feed log data into the analysis engine for processing**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. CLI can read and load a log file from the file system
2. Log file content is read line by line efficiently
3. Basic file validation is performed (file exists, readable, not empty)
4. Raw log lines are stored in memory or processed sequentially
5. System handles both small and reasonably large log files (up to 100MB)
6. Appropriate error handling for file access issues
7. Progress feedback is provided for large file processing

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create file ingestion service (AC: 1, 3, 6)
  - [x] Create src/loglens/services/ingestion.py module
  - [x] Implement LogFileIngester class with file validation
  - [x] Add error handling for file access, permissions, and format issues
  - [x] Implement file size and readability checks
- [x] Task 2: Implement line-by-line processing (AC: 2, 4, 5)
  - [x] Add generator-based file reading for memory efficiency
  - [x] Implement sequential line processing with yield patterns
  - [x] Add support for different text encodings (UTF-8, ASCII)
  - [x] Handle large files without loading entire content to memory
- [x] Task 3: Add progress feedback system (AC: 7)
  - [x] Implement progress tracking for large files
  - [x] Add CLI progress indicators using Typer
  - [x] Show file processing statistics (lines read, file size)
- [x] Task 4: Create data models for ingestion (AC: 4)
  - [x] Implement RawLogLine model in src/loglens/models.py
  - [x] Add file metadata tracking (filename, size, line count)
  - [x] Create ingestion result containers
- [x] Task 5: Integrate with main CLI (AC: 1)
  - [x] Update main.py analyze command to use ingestion service
  - [x] Add file ingestion as first step in analysis workflow
  - [x] Ensure proper error propagation to CLI user

## Dev Notes

### Technical Guidance

**Key Architecture Insights from Previous Story:**
- CLI framework (Typer) already established and working
- Project structure created with src/loglens/services/ ready for new modules
- Testing infrastructure in place with pytest

**Data Models Required** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
```python
# Expected RawLogLine model structure
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional

class RawLogLine(BaseModel):
    line_number: int
    content: str
    file_path: str
    timestamp_read: datetime
```

**File Locations** [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]:
- Ingestion service: `src/loglens/services/ingestion.py`
- Data models: `src/loglens/models.py` (extend existing)
- Tests: `tests/test_ingestion.py`

**Tech Stack Considerations** [Source: architecture/definitive-tech-stack-selections.md]:
- Use Pydantic for data validation and models
- Python 3.11+ file handling capabilities
- Type hints required for all functions

**Performance Requirements:**
- Handle files up to 100MB efficiently
- Use generator patterns to avoid memory issues
- Provide progress feedback for files > 1MB

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] pytest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: false), coverage requirement: 80%
- [x] pytest Integration Test: location: `tests/test_ingestion.py`
- [ ] E2E Test: Not required for ingestion layer

Manual Test Steps:
- Create test log files of various sizes (small: <1KB, medium: ~1MB, large: ~10MB)
- Run `loglens analyze [test-file]` and verify file ingestion works without errors
- Test with invalid files (non-existent, no permissions, binary files)
- Verify progress indicators appear for larger files
- Confirm memory usage remains reasonable with large files

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used: Claude Sonnet 4 (Dev Agent - James)

### Debug Log References

No debug log entries required - implementation proceeded smoothly without temporary changes.

### Completion Notes List

- **Generator Pattern Implementation**: Successfully implemented memory-efficient generator pattern for large file processing
- **Progress Feedback**: Added progress indicators that activate for files >1MB, showing percentage and processing stats
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for file access, encoding, and size validation issues
- **Data Models**: Extended models.py with RawLogLine, FileMetadata, and IngestionResult classes using Pydantic
- **CLI Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing Typer CLI, showing detailed ingestion statistics
- **Test Coverage**: Created 16 comprehensive tests covering all edge cases and requirements (100% pass rate)

**Key Implementation Decisions**:
- Used generator-based approach for memory efficiency with large files
- Progress updates every 1000 lines for performance
- Support for UTF-8, ASCII, and Latin-1 encodings with automatic detection
- File size limit set to 100MB as per requirements
- Error propagation preserves user-friendly messages in CLI

**Next Story Considerations**: 
- Ingestion service ready for Apache log parser integration
- RawLogLine models ready for parsing service consumption
- Generator pattern allows streaming processing for future parser implementations
