# Story 2.1: Integrate IP Reputation Service

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a **log analyst**
- I want **the system to enrich suspicious IP addresses with reputation data from external services**
- so that **I can quickly assess whether detected threats are from known malicious sources and prioritize my investigation efforts accordingly**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Enrichment service integrates with existing Detection workflow after findings generation
2. System performs automated IP reputation lookups for suspicious IP addresses found in detection results
3. IP reputation data is retrieved from free, public reputation services (AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, etc.)
4. Enrichment data is stored in Finding objects' enrichment_data field without modifying core detection logic
5. System handles API rate limits, timeouts, and failures gracefully without stopping analysis
6. Enrichment service supports configurable API keys and service selection
7. CLI displays enrichment statistics (IPs queried, successful lookups, API errors)
8. Enhanced findings with reputation data are available for next stage (reporting)

## Dev Notes

### Technical Guidance

**Key Architecture Insights from Previous Stories:**
- Finding objects available from Story 1.4 with structured detection results and enrichment_data field
- CLI framework established with progress feedback, verbose mode, and statistics display
- Error handling patterns proven effective for external service failures
- Pydantic models work well for API response validation and data normalization
- Generator patterns maintain memory efficiency with large datasets

**Enrichment Data Structure** [Source: architecture/data-models.md + Story 1.4]:
```python
# Enhanced Finding with enrichment data
class Finding(BaseModel):
    log_entry: ParsedLogEntry
    finding_type: str
    description: str
    risk_score: int = 50
    enrichment_data: Optional[dict] = None  # Enhanced with IP reputation data
    detected_at: datetime

# Enrichment data structure
enrichment_data = {
    "ip_reputation": {
        "abuseipdb": {
            "abuse_confidence": 75,  # 0-100 score
            "is_public": True,
            "country_code": "CN",
            "usage_type": "datacenter",
            "last_reported": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
        },
        "virustotal": {
            "malicious_count": 5,
            "suspicious_count": 2,
            "clean_count": 60,
            "reputation_score": -15,  # VT reputation score
            "last_analysis": "2024-01-15T09:45:00Z"
        },
        "enrichment_timestamp": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z",
        "providers_queried": ["abuseipdb", "virustotal"],
        "providers_successful": ["abuseipdb"],
        "providers_failed": ["virustotal"]
    }
}
```

**IP Reputation Services** [Source: functional requirements]:
- **AbuseIPDB**: Free tier allows 1,000 lookups/day, provides abuse confidence percentage
- **VirusTotal**: Free tier allows 500 lookups/day, provides detailed threat intelligence
- **Both services require API keys** for authentication
- **Rate limiting**: Must respect API quotas to avoid blocking

**File Locations** [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]:
- Enrichment service: `src/loglens/services/enrichment.py`
- Configuration management: `src/loglens/core/config.py`
- Enrichment tests: `tests/test_enrichment.py`
- CLI integration: `src/loglens/main.py`

**Tech Stack Considerations** [Source: architecture/definitive-tech-stack-selections.md]:
- Use httpx for async-capable HTTP API calls to reputation services
- Pydantic for API response validation and enrichment data modeling
- Type hints required for all enrichment methods
- Follow established error handling patterns from detection service
- Maintain generator patterns for memory efficiency

**Integration Requirements** [Source: Story 1.4 completion notes]:
- Enrichment service must accept Finding objects from detection service
- Preserve existing Finding structure while adding enrichment_data
- Follow established CLI integration pattern with statistics display
- Use same error handling patterns as detection service
- Maintain performance suitable for processing multiple IP addresses
- Ensure enriched findings are structured for next story (report generation)

**Performance Requirements:**
- Batch IP lookups to minimize API calls for duplicate IPs
- Implement caching to avoid redundant lookups within same analysis session
- Handle API timeouts gracefully (5-10 second timeout per request)
- Process enrichment asynchronously when possible
- Provide progress feedback for long-running enrichment operations

**API Integration Guidelines:**
- Store API keys in environment variables or config files
- Implement proper HTTP error handling (404, 429, 500, etc.)
- Add User-Agent headers for API requests
- Respect API rate limits with appropriate delays
- Log API usage for monitoring and debugging

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- Enrichment failures should not stop the analysis pipeline
- Partial enrichment is acceptable (some providers fail, others succeed)
- Log all API errors with details for debugging
- Provide fallback behavior when all enrichment providers fail
- Track enrichment statistics for user feedback

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] pytest Unit Tests: coverage requirement: 85%
- [ ] pytest Integration Test: location: `tests/test_enrichment.py`
- [ ] E2E Test: Not required for enrichment layer, mock API responses

**Unit Test Categories:**
- IP address extraction from Finding objects
- AbuseIPDB API integration with mocked responses
- VirusTotal API integration with mocked responses
- Rate limiting and timeout handling
- API error handling and retry logic
- Enrichment data structure validation
- Caching mechanism functionality
- Configuration management for API keys

**Sample Test Data Required:**
- Finding objects with suspicious IP addresses from Story 1.4
- Mocked API responses from AbuseIPDB and VirusTotal
- Various API error scenarios (rate limiting, timeouts, invalid keys)
- Edge cases with private IP addresses and invalid IPs
- Multiple findings with duplicate IP addresses for caching tests
- Configuration scenarios with missing or invalid API keys

**Mock API Response Examples:**
```python
# AbuseIPDB successful response
abuseipdb_response = {
    "data": {
        "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1",
        "isPublic": True,
        "abuseConfidencePercentage": 75,
        "countryCode": "CN",
        "usageType": "datacenter",
        "lastReportedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00+00:00"
    }
}

# VirusTotal successful response
virustotal_response = {
    "data": {
        "id": "192.168.1.1",
        "attributes": {
            "last_analysis_stats": {
                "malicious": 5,
                "suspicious": 2,
                "clean": 60,
                "undetected": 3
            },
            "reputation": -15,
            "last_analysis_date": 1705312500
        }
    }
}
```

Manual Test Steps:
- Create test log files with known malicious IP addresses
- Configure API keys for AbuseIPDB and VirusTotal
- Run `loglens analyze [attack-log-file] --verbose` and verify enrichment works
- Test with various IP types (public, private, invalid)
- Verify enrichment statistics display correctly
- Test API failure scenarios (invalid keys, rate limiting)
- Confirm enriched findings show reputation context
