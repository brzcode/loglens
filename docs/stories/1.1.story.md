# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & CLI Entry Point

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a **log analyst**
- I want **a command-line tool foundation**
- so that **I can begin processing log files for analysis**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. CLI tool is installable and executable
2. Basic project structure is established following architecture standards
3. CLI accepts command-line arguments and options
4. Tool can be invoked from command line and shows help/usage information
5. Development environment is properly configured with dependencies

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Initialize Python project structure (AC: 2, 5)
  - [x] Create Poetry project with pyproject.toml
  - [x] Set up src/loglens/ directory structure per architecture
  - [x] Initialize __init__.py files in all package directories
  - [x] Configure development dependencies (black, flake8, mypy, pytest)
- [x] Task 2: Create CLI entry point (AC: 1, 3, 4)
  - [x] Implement src/loglens/main.py with Typer CLI framework
  - [x] Add basic argument parsing for log file input
  - [x] Implement help/usage display functionality
  - [x] Configure entry point in pyproject.toml
- [x] Task 3: Set up development tooling (AC: 5)
  - [x] Configure black, flake8, mypy settings in pyproject.toml
  - [x] Create basic .gitignore file
  - [x] Set up basic README.md structure
- [x] Task 4: Create basic tests (AC: 1)
  - [x] Set up tests/ directory structure
  - [x] Create basic test for CLI entry point
  - [x] Verify pytest configuration works

## Dev Notes

### Technical Guidance

**Tech Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/definitive-tech-stack-selections.md]:
- Python 3.11+ as primary language
- Typer framework for CLI interface (modern alternative to argparse with autocompletion support)
- Pydantic for data validation and settings management
- Poetry for dependency management and packaging
- pytest for testing framework

**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]:
```plaintext
loglens/
├── src/
│   └── loglens/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── main.py             # CLI Handler & Orchestrator
│       ├── services/
│       │   ├── __init__.py
│       │   └── [future services]
│       ├── models.py           # Pydantic Data Models
│       └── core/
│           └── config.py       # Configuration management
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── [test files]
├── pyproject.toml              # Project metadata and dependencies
└── README.md
```

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Use black for auto-formatting, flake8 for linting, mypy for static type checking
- Naming: snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- All code must be fully type-hinted and pass mypy checks
- Configure tools in pyproject.toml

**File Locations**:
- Main CLI entry point: `src/loglens/main.py`
- Configuration: `pyproject.toml` (Poetry project file)
- Tests: `tests/test_main.py` (basic CLI tests)

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] pytest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: false), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Integration Test: Not required for initial scaffolding
- [ ] E2E Test: Not required for initial scaffolding

Manual Test Steps:
- After installation, run `loglens --help` to verify CLI tool is working
- Verify tool shows proper usage information and available options
- Confirm Poetry dependencies install correctly with `poetry install`

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used: Claude Sonnet 4 (Dev Agent)

### Debug Log References

No debug log entries required for this story.

### Completion Notes List

- Poetry not available in environment, manually created pyproject.toml with all required dependencies
- Fixed import path in version command to use relative import (from . import __version__)
- All tests passing (7/7) with comprehensive CLI coverage
- Project structure follows architecture specifications exactly
