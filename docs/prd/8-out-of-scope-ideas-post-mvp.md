# 8. Out of Scope Ideas Post MVP

This list captures valuable features and ideas that are intentionally excluded from the MVP to ensure a focused and rapid initial delivery. They will be considered for future versions of LogLens.

* Expanded Log Format Support: Develop and integrate additional modular parsers to support other common log types, such as Nginx, SSH, Windows Event Logs, and firewall logs.
* User-Defined Configurations: Allow users to provide a simple configuration file to add custom keywords, tune detector sensitivity, or whitelist known-good IP addresses.
* Multiple Output Formats: Add support for different output formats beyond plain text, such as JSON or HTML.
* Deeper Threat Intelligence: Integrate with more advanced threat intelligence APIs.
* Local GUI Interface: Explore adding a simple, local desktop GUI using a framework like Tkinter or PyQt for users who prefer not to use the command line.
