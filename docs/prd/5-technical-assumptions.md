# 5. Technical Assumptions

This section provides the initial technical context for the Architect.

**Repository & Service Architecture:** The project will be developed within a single repository. Given its nature as a standalone Python application, a monolithic structure is assumed. The core design must feature a modular "plug-and-play" architecture for log parsers to facilitate future expansion.

**Hosting/Cloud Provider:** No cloud hosting is required for the MVP, as the tool is designed to be a standalone, local application.
**Platform:** The application must be written in Python. The MVP is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool, so no separate frontend platform is required.
**Database Requirements:** No database is required for the MVP, as the tool's scope is to analyze a single log file per execution.
**Testing Requirements:** Initial verification will be conducted using manual test scripts. These scripts will be designed for early-stage validation and to gather usability feedback from L1 analysts.
