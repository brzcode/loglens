# 1. Goal, Objective, and Context

**Goal:** The primary goal of LogLens is to solve the "analysis paralysis" faced by Level 1 SOC analysts. It will transform large, cryptic log files into a clear, prioritized list of actionable items, enabling analysts to quickly identify potentially malicious behavior.

**Objective:** The objective is to empower L1 analysts to make faster, more confident triage decisions, thereby improving their organization's security posture and reducing analyst burnout. The tool aims to decrease the initial assessment time for a log file to under 30 seconds.

**Context:** LogLens is a lightweight, standalone Python application designed to run locally on an analyst's machine. The target user is a junior analyst who may not have deep expertise in various log formats or advanced attack patterns and is often overwhelmed by the volume and noise of raw log data.
