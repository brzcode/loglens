# LogLens Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Goal, Objective, and Context

**Goal:** The primary goal of LogLens is to solve the "analysis paralysis" faced by Level 1 SOC analysts. It will transform large, cryptic log files into a clear, prioritized list of actionable items, enabling analysts to quickly identify potentially malicious behavior.

**Objective:** The objective is to empower L1 analysts to make faster, more confident triage decisions, thereby improving their organization's security posture and reducing analyst burnout. The tool aims to decrease the initial assessment time for a log file to under 30 seconds.

**Context:** LogLens is a lightweight, standalone Python application designed to run locally on an analyst's machine. The target user is a junior analyst who may not have deep expertise in various log formats or advanced attack patterns and is often overwhelmed by the volume and noise of raw log data.

## 2. Functional Requirements (MVP)

* **Log File Ingestion:** The system shall accept a single log file as an input parameter.
* **Log Parsing:** The system shall parse a specified log format, with the initial version focused on Apache Access Logs. The system must be designed to allow for other parser modules in the future.
* **Pattern Detection:** The system shall analyze the parsed log data to detect a predefined set of suspicious patterns, including but not limited to:

  * Repeated failed login attempts.
  * Common web attack keywords (e.g., SQL injection, command execution patterns).
  * Anomalous request frequency from a single IP address.
* **IP Reputation Enrichment:** For any suspicious IP address identified, the system shall perform an automated lookup against a free, public IP reputation service to retrieve and store additional context.
* **Summary Report Generation:** The system shall generate a human-readable, text-based summary report displayed directly in the user's console.
* **Report Prioritization:** The summary report shall be prioritized to display the top 3-5 most critical findings first.
* **Noise Filtering:** The summary report shall only include suspicious findings, filtering out all benign log entries to reduce noise for the analyst.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements (MVP)

**Performance:**

* The tool must be able to process a large log file (e.g., up to 200MB) and produce a summary report in under 20 seconds to meet the overall goal of "triage under 30 seconds."
* Memory usage should remain reasonable and not spike excessively, ensuring it can run on a standard analyst workstation.

**Usability:**

* The Command-Line Interface (CLI) must be simple, requiring no more than two arguments to run an analysis (e.g., loglens \<parser\_type> \<file\_path>).
* The final report output must be clear, concise, and formatted for easy readability in a standard terminal. It should use spacing and simple markers (\[!], \[+]) to improve scannability.
* Error messages must be user-friendly and provide clear guidance on what went wrong (e.g., "Error: File not found at path '...").

**Reliability:**

* The log parser must be robust enough to handle common variations and malformed lines within its target log format without crashing.
* The tool must handle failures from the external IP reputation service gracefully (e.g., by skipping the enrichment for that IP and noting the failure in the output, rather than halting the entire analysis).

**Installation:**

* The tool must be easy to install via standard Python packaging tools (e.g., pip).
* It must have minimal external dependencies to avoid installation conflicts and ensure it is lightweight.

## 4. User Interaction and Design Goals

**Overall Experience:** The interaction should be immediate and direct. The tool should feel like a fast, reliable utility that provides answers without unnecessary configuration or "chattiness." The experience should instill a sense of empowerment and clarity.

**Key Interaction Paradigm:**

* Command-Line Driven: All interaction will be through a terminal interface.
* Argument-Based Control: The user will control the analysis by providing simple arguments, primarily the parser type and the file path.
* Text as the UI: The "user interface" is the formatted text report printed to the console. It must be well-structured, using spacing and minimal symbols for maximum readability on a standard terminal screen.

**Conceptual "Views" / Outputs:**

* Default View (Summary Report): The standard output when running the tool is the prioritized summary report of the top 3-5 findings.
* Verbose View (Optional): A command-line flag (e.g., -v or --verbose) should be available to show more detailed information for each finding or to list a larger number of findings.
* Help View: A standard --help or -h flag must be implemented to display a clear, concise help message explaining the available commands, arguments, and flags.

**Target Platform:** The tool must function correctly and be readable in standard terminal environments, including bash, zsh, and PowerShell.

## 5. Technical Assumptions

This section provides the initial technical context for the Architect.

**Repository & Service Architecture:** The project will be developed within a single repository. Given its nature as a standalone Python application, a monolithic structure is assumed. The core design must feature a modular "plug-and-play" architecture for log parsers to facilitate future expansion.

**Hosting/Cloud Provider:** No cloud hosting is required for the MVP, as the tool is designed to be a standalone, local application.
**Platform:** The application must be written in Python. The MVP is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool, so no separate frontend platform is required.
**Database Requirements:** No database is required for the MVP, as the tool's scope is to analyze a single log file per execution.
**Testing Requirements:** Initial verification will be conducted using manual test scripts. These scripts will be designed for early-stage validation and to gather usability feedback from L1 analysts.

## 6. Epic Overview

**Epic 1: Core Analysis Engine & CLI**
**Goal:** To build the foundational, functioning command-line tool that can ingest a single log file, parse it, apply basic detection patterns, and output a raw list of findings. This epic delivers the core processing capability.

* Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & CLI Entry Point
* Story 1.2: Log File Ingestion
* Story 1.3: Implement Apache Log Parser
* Story 1.4: Basic Keyword-Based Detection

**Epic 2: IP Reputation & Report Refinement**
**Goal:** To enhance the core tool by adding external IP reputation context to the findings and refining the final output into a clear, prioritized summary report for the analyst. This epic delivers the "intelligence" layer.

* Story 2.1: Integrate IP Reputation Service
* Story 2.2: Implement Additional Detection Logic (Frequency)
* Story 2.3: Format and Prioritize the Final Report

## 7. Key Reference Documents

{This section will be populated with links to the Architecture Document and other key artifacts as they are created in later phases.}

## 8. Out of Scope Ideas Post MVP

This list captures valuable features and ideas that are intentionally excluded from the MVP to ensure a focused and rapid initial delivery. They will be considered for future versions of LogLens.

* Expanded Log Format Support: Develop and integrate additional modular parsers to support other common log types, such as Nginx, SSH, Windows Event Logs, and firewall logs.
* User-Defined Configurations: Allow users to provide a simple configuration file to add custom keywords, tune detector sensitivity, or whitelist known-good IP addresses.
* Multiple Output Formats: Add support for different output formats beyond plain text, such as JSON or HTML.
* Deeper Threat Intelligence: Integrate with more advanced threat intelligence APIs.
* Local GUI Interface: Explore adding a simple, local desktop GUI using a framework like Tkinter or PyQt for users who prefer not to use the command line.
