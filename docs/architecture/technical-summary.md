# Technical Summary

LogLens is a standalone, command-line Python application architected as a modular monolith. It operates by ingesting a single log file, processing it through a series of specialized components—including a pluggable parsing service, a detection engine, and an external API enrichment service—and generating a prioritized, text-based summary report. The architecture prioritizes simplicity, modularity for future expansion (especially for new log formats), and performance to meet the rapid triage goals outlined in the PRD.
