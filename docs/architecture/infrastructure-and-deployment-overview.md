# Infrastructure and Deployment Overview

  * **Deployment Strategy:** The application will be packaged as a Python wheel and distributed via **PyPI (Python Package Index)**. This allows for simple installation for users via `pip install loglens`.
  * **CI/CD pipeline:** A GitHub Actions workflow will be configured to run on every push to the `main` branch. It will execute linting (`flake8`), type checking (`mypy`), and run all automated tests (`pytest`). On a tagged release, it will automatically build and publish the package to PyPI.
  * **Environments:** The primary environment is the user's local machine. There are no dev/staging/prod server environments.
